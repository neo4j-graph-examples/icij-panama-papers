== The Shape of the Data

model]

The Offshore Leaks Database contains in a structured way the contents of
the more than 3 million database files inside the Paradise and Panama
Papers leaks and the client databases from the Offshore Leaks
investigation.

The Offshore Leaks Database was imported into Neo4j to be used by
journalists and researchers to take advantage of the connections in the
data. To the left is the basic "property graph" data model. Each data
record is called a "node" representing an entity, intermediary, officer
or address. They're connected to form a "graph" that reveals a complex
web of relationships. To the left you can see a simplified diagram how
the nodes connect to each other.

These are the types of nodes that you will encounter in the data:

* `Entity` - The offshore legal entity. This could be a company, trust,
foundation, or other legal entity created in a low-tax jurisdiction.
* `Officer` - A person or company who plays a role in an offshore
entity, such as beneficiary, director, or shareholder. The relationships
shown in the diagram are just a sample of all the existing ones.
* `Intermediary` - A go-between for someone seeking an offshore
corporation and an offshore service provider — usually a law-firm or a
middleman that asks an offshore service provider to create an offshore
firm.
* `Address` - The registered address as it appears in the original
databases obtained by ICIJ.
* `Other` - Other entities found in the data.

== Cypher Introduction

 +

=== Graph Patterns

Neo4j’s query language, Cypher, is centered around *graph patterns*
which represents entities with parentheses, for example, +
`(e:Entity)` and connections with arrows, for example
`-[:INTERMEDIARY_OF]->`. `:Entity` and `:INTERMEDIARY_OF` are the types
of the entity and the connection, respectively.

Here is an example pattern:
`(:Intermediary)-[:INTERMEDIARY_OF]->(:Entity)`. These patterns may be
found with the `MATCH` clause.

=== Other Clauses

The following clauses may follow a `MATCH` clause. They work with the
properties stored at the nodes and relationships found in the graph
matching that pattern.

filter

`WHERE intermediary.name CONTAINS 'MOSSACK'`

aggregate

`WITH e.jurisdiction AS country, COUNT(*) AS frequency`

return

`RETURN country, frequency`

order

`ORDER BY frequency DESC`

limit

`LIMIT 20;`

== Nodes

image:https://offshoreleaks-data.icij.org/offshoreleaks/neo4j/guide/img/datamodel.png[data
model,scaledwidth=50.0%]

Nodes are the entities in the graph. These are the types of nodes that
you will encounter in the Paradise and Panama Papers data:

* `Entity` - The offshore legal entity. This could be a entity, trust,
foundation, or other legal entity.
* `Officer` - Either the beneficiary, director, or shareholder of the
offshore legal entity.
* `Intermediary` - A go-between for someone seeking an offshore
corporation and an offshore service provider — usually a law-firm or a
middleman that asks an offshore service provider to create an offshore
firm for a intermediary.
* `Address` - The registered address according to the information on
file.
* `Other` - Other entities found in the data.

== Relationships

image:https://offshoreleaks-data.icij.org/offshoreleaks/neo4j/guide/img/datamodel.png[data
model,scaledwidth=50.0%]

Relationships connect the nodes in the graph.

The following relationships appear in the data model:

* `(:Intermediary)-[:INTERMEDIARY_OF]->(:Entity)`
* `(:Officer|Intermediary)-[:UNDERLYING]->(:Intermediary|Officer)`
* `(:Intermediary|Officer|Entity)-[:REGISTERED_ADDRESS]->(:Address)`
* `(:Officer|Intermediary)-[:OFFICER_OF]->(:Entity)`

All relationship types in the graph

----
MATCH (n)-[r]->(m) 
WITH labels(n) AS fromLabel,type(r) AS relType, collect(distinct head(labels(m))) AS toLabels, count(*) AS frequency 
WHERE frequency > 1000
RETURN fromLabel, relType,toLabels,frequency ORDER BY frequency DESC;
----

We will next walk through each node type and see what properties are
available for each.

== Intermediary

image:https://offshoreleaks-data.icij.org/offshoreleaks/neo4j/guide/img/datamodel.png[data
model,scaledwidth=50.0%]

Each `Intermediary` node represents a go-between for someone seeking an
offshore corporation and an offshore service provider — usually a
law-firm or a middleman that asks an offshore service provider to create
an offshore firm for a intermediary.

== Properties

Each `Intermediary` node has the following properties:

* `name` - The name of the intermediary.
* `address` - The address of the intermediary.
* `sourceID` - `Offshore Leaks` `Panama Papers` or `Paradise Papers`
depending on the data’s source
* `status`
* `valid_until`
* `country_codes,countries`

the address node connected to this Entity node through a
REGISTERED_ADDRESS relationship.
